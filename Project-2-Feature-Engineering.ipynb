    "I ran this model with all columns in the beginning, and two of the highest (negative) coefficients were interactions with `Misc Val` and `Pool Area`, both of which have high proportions of values that equal 0 in the dataframe. I looked at the proportions of 0-values in both columns, which were almost 100% each. This means that when an interaction term is made with one of these columns, almost all of the values will also be 0, regardless of what the values are for the other variable of the interaction term. Therefore, I removed these columns, along with `Pool QC` (the proportion of 0s is exactly the same as in `Pool Area`), in my matrix of features."

    "The first thing I notice is that every variable in this list is an interaction term. Another thing I notice is that, as I suspected, the interaction between `Year Built` and `Year Remod/Add` has a relatively high predictive value.\n",

    "It does not surprise me that the interaction between `Overall Qual` and `Gr Liv Area` has the highest coefficient. It makes logical sense that the overall quality of a house and the total above-ground living area in square feet would have a quite large effect on the price of that house.\n",

    "For the sake of memory and time, I do not want to include every categorical dummy variable in my final model, so I will use these coefficients as a way to choose which ones to include. I absolutely want to include the `Neighborhood` column because the neighborhood in which a house is located will undoubtedly greatly affect its price. I also notice a high number of coefficients with `Exterior 1st`, `Condition_1`, `Foundation`, and `SaleType`, so I will one-hot encode and include these variables in my final model.\n",
