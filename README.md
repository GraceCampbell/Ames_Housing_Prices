# Project 2 - Ames Housing Data

*Author: Grace Campbell*

## Problem Statement

I have been given data from the Ames Housing Dataset, which according to the data description "...contains information from the Ames Assessorâ€™s Office used in computing assessed values for individual residential properties sold in Ames, IA from 2006 to 2010." I want to know which features of a property have the greatest effect on the price of the property at sale, and then be able to predict the price of a house based on those features.

#### Note:
This project is part of a competition on Kaggle. This data has two parts: a training set, on which I will be performing explanatory analysis and fitting my model, and a final hold-out test set. I only have access to the explanatory variable data for the test set; I do not know the values for the target variable. I will find out the final performance of my model on the test set when I submit its predictions to Kaggle.


## Modeling Steps
1. Perform a log transformation on `y` because its distribution is positively skewed
2. One-hot encode the categorical variables in the dataset so they can be included in the model
3. Transform all explanatory variables with `PolynomialFeatures` to better capture the the explanatory variables' relationships with the target and with each other
4. Scale the variables with `StandardScaler` 
5. Fit the data to a `Lasso` regularization

## Final Model Performance
My final model has an  $R^2$  score of 0.839, which means about ~84% of the variance in the data can be explained by my model compared to the null model.
